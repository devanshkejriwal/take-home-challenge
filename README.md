# Take-Home Challenge

Welcome to the take-home coding challenge part of your journey. We are excited about your interest to join us on our mission to help Canadians build and access credit.
In the spirit of fairness, we ask that **all** of our candidates go through a take-home coding challenge. 


## Here are some general instructions

_Follow these instructions carefully_

* From the moment you receive this challenge, you will have exactly __1 week__ to complete it. The challenge should only take a few hours to complete, so plan your time as you see fit.
* You are allowed to use whatever references online __but__ your work must be yours alone, collaboration is not permitted.
* Follow the submission instruction clearly and pay attention to details.
* ~~Do __one__ (1) of the challenge~~ Please do the `/backend` challenge as our other challenges are WIP
* Fork this github repo into your own **private** repo and add `han@nyble.com` as a collaborator. 
* Follow the challenge specific instructions in the folder `/<challenge_name>/instructions.md`
* Once completed, follow the submission instructions below.


## How we review

1. We value correctness over completeness. If you are unable to complete all the aspect of the challenge, make sure that the parts you do complete are correct
2. Attention to details, we value that alot, so make sure to follow the instructions clearly and feel free to re-read the prompt or questions.
3. Pay attention to your software architecture and design, be able to understand the trade-offs of your proposed solution versus alternative ways to implement. Be ready to be able to clearly communicate your design and implementation choices during the review call. 
4. Code quality. This is pretty self-explanatory. Although your code from this challenge will never be used, please write production-quality code with all the best practices. 

**Bonus**
5. Think about scalability
6. Think about vulnerabilities



## How to submit

_Follow these instructions carefully, wrong or faulty submissions will be ignored_

(Pre-conditions: All of your work should be on a separate branch and the `main` branch should be intact and unchanged from the fork)

* Git squash all of your commits into a single commit. If not sure how to do this, google it or read this (https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash)
* Open a new **Pull Request** from your working branch into `main` and title it `Take-Home Challenge Submission`
* In the PR clearly write the following
  * Your name and email
  * Briefly write in a section about your solution and design
* Add `han@nyble.com` or `hanburger97` as a reviewer.
* Open the pull request.
* Send an email to `han@nyble.com` notifying that you are ready for review.
